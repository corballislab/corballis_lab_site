I completed my BSc and MSc degrees at the University of Auckland before undertaking doctoral studies at Columbia University in New York City.  After completing my PhD, I spent the next several years in the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. In 2002 I joined the School of Psychology at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, where I remained until returning to the University of Auckland in June of 2011.\n:::\n\n::::\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Courtney Haselton\n**Honours Student**\n\n:::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-7}\nNA \n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-5}\n![](images/NA){width=100% height=auto}\n:::\n\n::::\n\n---\n\n# Eric Rosentreter\n**PhD Student**\n\n:::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-5}\n![](images/eric.jpg){width=100% height=auto}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-7}\nEric is a PhD student in the field of cognitive neuroscience, with a specific focus on visual selective attention. He is a dedicated and enthusiastic researcher who is committed to advancing our understanding of how the brain processes and filters visual information.\nEric's research centers on the mechanisms of attentional control, exploring how we selectively attend to certain features in the visual environment while ignoring others. He is particularly interested in the neural underpinnings of attentional processes and how they are affected by factors such as task demands and cognitive load. \n:::\n\n::::\n\n---\n\n# Daniele Scanzi\n**PhD Student**\n\n:::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-7}\nDaniele completed his Bachelor of Science in Psychology and Communication at the University of Milan â€“ Bicocca in 2018. He joined the University of Auckland in 2021 as an Honours student. He is now starting a PhD working with Paul Corballis, director of the Cognitive Psychophysiology Lab, and is co-advised by Christopher Erb. He is interested in investigating the neural correlates of consciousness using EEG, eye-tracking and whatever other machinery he can get his hands on. He has a second identity as a magician and his assistant is a tiny blue plunger. \n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-5}\n![](images/daniele.jpg){width=100% height=auto}\n:::\n\n::::\n\n---\n\n# Andre Botes\n**PhD Student**\n\n:::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-5}\n![](images/andre.jpg){width=100% height=auto}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-7}\nAndre is a PhD student investigating how we use value assessments affect how we make every day decisions. Andre is interested in question about how behaviour is controlled to meet our goals and what mechanisms we use to make this happen. Before starting his doctorate, Andre worked on projects using virtual reality and EEG. \n:::\n\n::::\n\n---\n\n# Katie Smith\n**PhD Student**\n\n:::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-7}\nNA \n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-5}\n![](images/katie.jpg){width=100% height=auto}\n:::\n\n::::\n\n---\n\n# Carley Braddock\n**PhD Student**\n\n:::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-5}\n![](images/carley.jpg){width=100% height=auto}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-7}\nNA \n:::\n\n::::\n\n---\n\n# Sam Morrison\n**PhD Student**\n\n:::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-7}\nNA \n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-5}\n![](images/NA){width=100% height=auto}\n:::\n\n::::\n\n---\n\n# Darrilyn Li\n**Masters Student**\n\n:::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-5}\n![](images/NA){width=100% height=auto}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-7}\nNA \n:::\n\n::::\n\n---\n\n# Tamar McCambridge\n**Masters Student**\n\n:::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-7}\nNA \n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-5}\n![](images/NA){width=100% height=auto}\n:::\n\n::::\n\n---\n\n# Heba Mortaja\n**Masters Student**\n\n:::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-5}\n![](images/NA){width=100% height=auto}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-7}\nNA \n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n---",

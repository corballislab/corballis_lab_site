He is a dedicated and enthusiastic researcher who is committed to advancing our understanding of how the brain processes and filters visual information. Eric’s research centers on the mechanisms of attentional control, exploring how we selectively attend to certain features in the visual environment while ignoring others. He is particularly interested in the neural underpinnings of attentional processes and how they are affected by factors such as task demands and cognitive load.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarrilyn Li\nMasters Student\n\n\n\n\n\nplaceholder text\n\n\n\n\n\nCarley Braddock\nPhD Student\n\n\nplaceholder text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniele Scanzi\nPhD Student\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniele completed his Bachelor of Science in Psychology and Communication at the University of Milan – Bicocca in 2018. He joined the University of Auckland in 2021 as an Honours student. He is now starting a PhD working with Paul Corballis, director of the Cognitive Psychophysiology Lab, and is co-advised by Christopher Erb. He is interested in investigating the neural correlates of consciousness using EEG, eye-tracking and whatever other machinery he can get his hands on. He has a second identity as a magician and his assistant is a tiny blue plunger.\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney Haselton\nHonours Student\n\n\nplaceholder text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatie Smith\nPhD Student\n\n\n\n\n\nplaceholder text\n\n\n\n\n\nAndre Botes\nPhD Student\n\n\nAndre is a PhD student investigating how we use value assessments affect how we make every day decisions. Andre is interested in question about how behaviour is controlled to meet our goals and what mechanisms we use to make this happen. Before starting his doctorate, Andre worked on projects using virtual reality and EEG."

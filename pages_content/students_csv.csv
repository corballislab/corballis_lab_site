Eric Rosentreter,PhD Student,"Eric is a PhD student in the field of cognitive neuroscience, with a specific focus on visual selective attention. He is a dedicated and enthusiastic researcher who is committed to advancing our understanding of how the brain processes and filters visual information.
Eric's research centers on the mechanisms of attentional control, exploring how we selectively attend to certain features in the visual environment while ignoring others. He is particularly interested in the neural underpinnings of attentional processes and how they are affected by factors such as task demands and cognitive load.",eric.jpg
